# bx2cloud

See the full [documentation here](https://benasb.github.io/bx2cloud/).

At its core, bx2cloud is a gRPC API providing services similar to what you would see in cloud providers. It's built for educational purposes and, for simplicity, designed to run on a single machine.

The following services are currently available:
- Networking
- Container

You can interact with the API through:

- The bx2cloud [CLI](https://benasb.github.io/bx2cloud/cli/getting-started)
- The bx2cloud [Terraform provider](https://benasb.github.io/bx2cloud/terraform/getting-started)
- Your own gRPC client

All of the applications are written in Go.
