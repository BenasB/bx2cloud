# Installation

The bx2cloud Terraform provider is not hosted on the public Terraform registry (registry.terraform.io) as of yet, but it's possible to install the provider binary manually.

1. Firstly, download the provider binary for your OS and architecture from the GitHub Releases. WIP ðŸš§

2. Determine your [implied Terraform local mirror directory](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/config/config-file#implied-local-mirror-directories)
<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">
    <blockquote>%APPDATA%/terraform.d/plugins</blockquote>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="mac" label="macOS">
    <blockquote>$HOME/.terraform.d/plugins</blockquote>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
    <blockquote>$HOME/.terraform.d/plugins</blockquote>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

3. In the plugins directory, create the following structure

> terraform.d/plugins/local/benasb/bx2cloud/\<version\>/\<os\>_\<arch\>

4. Place the downloaded binary into the newly created directory and make sure that it is named as `terraform-provider-bx2cloud`. A suffix `.exe` is required if you are on Windows.
