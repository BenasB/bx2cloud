# Networking

bx2cloud implements primitive virtual public cloud (VPC) networking functionality through its `network` and `subnetwork` resources.

### Network

A network is a resource representing a logical network where compute resources can be placed. It is isolated, so resources on one network do not have connectivity with resources on another network. A network is implemented as a linux network namespace. It handles routing between subnetworks (see below) and additionaly handles source NAT and provides connectivity to the host's interfaces.

#### Creating a network

<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">
  ```sh
  bx2cloud network create examples/api/network/create.yaml
  ```
  ```yaml title="examples/api/network/create.yaml"
  internetAccess: true
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="tf" label="Terraform">
  ```hcl
  resource "bx2cloud_network" "my_network" {
    internet_access = true
  }
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>



### Subnetwork

Within a network, a subnetwork resource can be defined. A subnetwork represents a range of IPs (expressed in [CIDR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing) notation) that compute resources can use. It is implemented as a linux bridge interface in the network's linux network namespace. 

The network resource can be treated as an L3 router which connects multiple L2 switches (subnetwork resources).

#### Creating a subnetwork

<Tabs groupId="interface">
  <TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">
  ```sh
  bx2cloud subnetwork create examples/api/subnetwork/create.yaml
  ```
  ```yaml title="examples/api/subnetwork/create.yaml"
  networkId: 4
  cidr: 10.0.42.0/24
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="tf" label="Terraform">
  ```hcl
  resource "bx2cloud_subnetwork" "my_subnetwork" {
    network_id = bx2cloud_network.my_network.id
    cidr       = "10.0.42.0/24"
  }
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
