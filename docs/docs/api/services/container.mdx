# Container

bx2cloud implements primitive container runtime functionality through its `container` resource.

A user is able to create a container based on any image from an OCI compliant registry (e.g. Docker Hub, quay.io) and control the container's lifecycle (start, stop). During creation, a container resource must be attached to a [subnetwork](./networking.mdx#subnetwork) resource and an arbitrary IP from the subnetwork's IP range is allocated.

:::info

As of now, there is *no* caching of image layers and each new container receives it's own completely separate rootfs. Future work should add support for [OverlayFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OverlayFS).

:::

:::warning

Registry authentication with credentials (private registries) is *not* supported as of now.
