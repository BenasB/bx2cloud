# Installation

Installing bx2cloud API can be done in multiple ways:

1. Binary download
2. Container image
3. Building from source

### Requirements

- The API supports running only on Linux, since most of the functionality depends on it (such as linux namespaces or networking).
- It also requires root privileges (to create linux namespaces, set up network routes, enable certain sysctl options).

## 1. Binary download

It's possible to download a pre-built binary of the API from GitHub releases. ðŸš§

## 2. Container image

A container image is available on Docker Hub. ðŸš§

## 3. Building from source
