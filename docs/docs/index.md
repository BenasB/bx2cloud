# Introduction

Welcome to the bx2cloud documentation!

At its core, bx2cloud is an API providing services similar to what you would see in cloud providers. It's built for educational purposes and designed to run on a single machine (hence sometimes the documentation may call it 'local').

You can interact with the API through:

- The bx2cloud [CLI](./cli/getting-started.md)
- The bx2cloud [Terraform provider](./terraform/getting-started.md)
- Your own gRPC client
