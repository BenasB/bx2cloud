# Introduction

Welcome to the bx2cloud documentation!

At its core, bx2cloud is a gRPC API providing services similar to what you would see in cloud providers. It's built for educational purposes and, for simplicity, designed to run on a single machine (hence sometimes the documentation may call it 'local').

You can interact with the API through:

- The bx2cloud [CLI](./cli/getting-started.md)
- The bx2cloud [Terraform provider](./terraform/getting-started.md)
- Your own gRPC client

All of the applications are written in Go.
